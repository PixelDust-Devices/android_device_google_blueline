# android_device_google_blueline

This repo has the sole purpose of providing the dependencies for blueline. The new version of our roomservice requires that a device tree exists in the PixelDust-Devices repo according to the following scheme: android_device_manufacturer_device.
In the case of blueline, the device name cannot be crosshatch. Sure right? : D
